/**
 * <p>
 * This class provides a SOAP utility for the
 * {@link com.liferay.portlet.trash.service.TrashEntryServiceUtil} service utility. The
 * static methods of this class calls the same methods of the service utility.
 * However, the signatures are different because it is difficult for SOAP to
 * support certain types.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * ServiceBuilder follows certain rules in translating the methods. For example,
 * if the method in the service utility returns a {@link java.util.List}, that
 * is translated to an array of {@link com.liferay.portlet.trash.model.TrashEntrySoap}.
 * If the method in the service utility returns a
 * {@link com.liferay.portlet.trash.model.TrashEntry}, that is translated to a
 * {@link com.liferay.portlet.trash.model.TrashEntrySoap}. Methods that SOAP cannot
 * safely wire are skipped.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The benefits of using the SOAP utility is that it is cross platform
 * compatible. SOAP allows different languages like Java, .NET, C++, PHP, and
 * even Perl, to call the generated services. One drawback of SOAP is that it is
 * slow because it needs to serialize all calls into a text format (XML).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can see a list of services at http://localhost:8080/api/axis. Set the
 * property <b>axis.servlet.hosts.allowed</b> in portal.properties to configure
 * security.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The SOAP utility is only generated for remote services.
